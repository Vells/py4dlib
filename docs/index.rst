Welcome to py4dlib's documentation!
===================================

The `py4dlib` library is a collection of Python modules to ease development
of scripts and plugins for MAXON's `CINEMA 4D <http://www.maxon.net>`_ 3D application.

It's goal is to provide essentials and convenience functions   
left out by CINEMA 4D's current Python SDK so that repetition and   
code duplication can be avoided.

It includes routines for working with c4d objects, polygonal modelling, 
some utilities and tools for writing plugins and math routines needed for 3D work.
