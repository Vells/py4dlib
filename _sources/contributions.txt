Contributions
-------------

I'd be very happy to accept code contributions. If you'd like to contribute  
please fork this repository, commit your changes to your local fork and then  
send me a pull request.

If that's too much of a hassle, you can also go ahead and create a gist and   
send me the URL so that I can include the code.
