Installation
------------

Take the `py4dlib` folder which you can find under `/source` in   
this repository, and put it under the following path::

    <USER_FOLDER>/library/python/packages/<OS>

`<USER_FOLDER>` is the prefs directory for CINEMA 4D in your home   
directory and `<OS>` is the name of the operating system you are   
running. 

For example on OS X this path could be::

    /Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/MAXON/CINEMA 4D R<VERSIONSTRING>/library/python/packages/osx

On Windows this path could be::

    %APPDATA%\MAXON\CINEMA 4D R<VERSIONSTRING>\library\python\packages\win64
